  ♻️ Recycling Platform
</h1>

We are trying to raise awareness to the importance of recycling. This is a [Google Solution Challenge 2024](https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc-solution-challenge) project that uses Firebase (authentication, analytics, firestore and storage) as well as latest technologies such as React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion to ensure best user experience. [Click here for the real-life app](https://recycling.is-important.net).




## Features
- Easy to use and simple UI.
- Efficient data with Firestore.
- User authentication with Firebase.
- Admin dashboard.
- Nearby recycling centers map with Google Maps API.
- File upload with Filepond to Firebase Storage.
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion and FormKit AutoAnimate.

## Techstack

- React.js & Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Google Analytics
- Firebase (firestore, authentication, storage, analytics)
- PWA (native apps, offline access)

## Quick start

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed on your system. Node.js comes with a package manager called `npm` but I suggest you use [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) instead since it's faster and more efficient.

1. Clone the repository:
   - `git clone https://github.com/eggsy/recycling-platform`
2. Install dependencies:
   - `pnpm install` or `npm install`
3. Create a Firestore account and get required fileds in `.env.example` file.
4. Fill in the required fields and rename it to `.env.local`.
5. Run the app:
   - `pnpm run dev` or `npm run dev` for development mode.
   - `<pnpm/npm> run build` and `<pnpm/npm> start` for production mode.
